                    <p>Parents are facing unique challenges of working from home
                    while simultaneously juggling home life.
                    At the same time, their children are trapped indoors,
                    cut off from their friends, and the routine and structure
                    of a school day have been entirely disrupted.</p>

                @component('components.voice', ['voice' => 'Teacher'])
                    <p>Teachers are struggling to support students
                    remotely. This introduces challenges in
                    preparing educational materials that translate
                    from the classroom to a computer, and
                    competing with the distractions they and their students
                    face at home.</p>

                @component('components.voice', ['voice' => 'Student'])
                    <p>Students have to adapt to a wide variety of new
                    challenges such as shifting to online classes,
                    managing internet bandwidth issues, pausing research
                    projects, and caring for younger siblings and loved ones.</p>

                @component('components.voice', ['voice' => 'Health worker'])
                    <p>Health workers are on the front line of this crisis,
                    and risk their own health and those they come
                    into contact with. They are also faced with the suffering
                    and fear of patients.
                    The uncertainty and stressful circumstances
                    can take an emotional toll.</p>

                @component('components.voice', ['voice' => 'Patient'])
                    <p>Whether a patient has mild or severe symptoms,
                    this crisis has denied patients the comfort of visitors.
                    This isolation and concern for their health
                    and for those they may have come into contact with
                    can leave them feeling lonely and frightened.</p>

                @component('components.voice', ['voice' => 'Other'])
                    <p>Social distancing and the isolation of sheltering in
                    has impacted people in ways they could not have foreseen.
                    Beyond loneliness, there can be a sense of fear and
                    uncertainty of what the future has in store.</p>
